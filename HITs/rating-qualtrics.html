<p><b>Context</b>: We are designing apps to help people write.
People wrote restaurant reviews using our app and not using our app, and we
want to know how the app changed their writing.</p>

<p><b>Your role</b> is to evaluate reviews according to criteria we provide.</p>

<p><b>This is a beta-test HIT, so we're doing an abbreviated version. We welcome your feedback.</b></p>

<p>This is a research study conducted under the supervision of
the Harvard University Committee on the Use of Human Subjects. By accepting
this HIT, you agree that you have read the Consent Form below and consent to
participate in the experiment it describes. Please save or print a copy of the

<p>It is your choice whether or not to participate in this
research.&nbsp; If you choose to participate, you may change your mind and
leave the study at any time by returning the HIT.&nbsp; Refusal to participate

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What
is the purpose of this research?</span></b></p>

<p>We are studying the design of
systems that make suggestions while someone is typing.</p>


<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What
can I expect if I take part in this research? What is the time commitment?</span></b>
</p>

<p>You will annotate restaurant reviews written by others according to rubrics that we supply.</p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What
are the risks and possible discomforts?</span></b></p>

<p>There are no anticipated risks
beyond normal use of a computer or smartphone. Please take a break if you start
to feel any discomfort from prolonged computer use.</p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Are
there any benefits from being in this research study? </span></b></p>

<p>We cannot promise any benefits
to you or others from your taking part in this research. The results of this
research may inform future advances in computer systems that assist writing.</p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Will
I be compensated for participating in this research?</span></b></p>

<p>The reward for this HIT is based
on a target pay rate of $9/hr.</p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>If
I take part in this research, how will my privacy be protected? What happens to
the information you collect? </span></b></p>

<p>We will not record any
personally identifying information. De-identified data may be shared with other
researchers and other participants in this study.</p>

<p>The MTurk platform provides
access to your worker ID, which in some cases can be mapped to your name and
work history. We are relying on the security of that platform to maintain your
confidentiality. To partially mitigate the risk of re-identification, we will
assign you a random identifier specific to this study and delete the mapping
between this identifier and your worker ID 6 months after the experiment
concludes. But if the security of the MTurk platform or our account is
breached, it may be possible to re-identify your work, as with any MTurk task. <b>Please
make sure to mark your Amazon Profile as private</b> if you do not want it to
be found from your Mechanical Turk Worker ID.</p>

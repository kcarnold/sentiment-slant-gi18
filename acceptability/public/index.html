"context": "let me begin with what we all want to glean from a quick glance at a restaurant's page : yes , it was absolutely fantastic . if you're trini and you're looking for an authentic taste of home , go to caribbean palace . now let's get into the juicy details . quality trinidadian food is notoriously difficult to find in the dc metropolitan area . i myself had to bend my rule of never entering the state of maryland under any circumstances to find this restaurant this , if nothing else , speaks to the rarity of the cuisine . caribbean palace is the best trinidadian food i've had since the last time i visited the island . there are specific qualities that make trini food as delicious as it is . the thinness and delicacy of the roti . the unique blend of ingredients which make aloo pie and doubles hot without sacrificing flavour . the juicy pieces of well seasoned meat wrapped in the roti shell . caribbean palace has all of this and more . i was especially impressed with the way they got the flavour of the doubles right for reference : teddy's in nw make their doubles too sweet . it's disconcerting in a dish that's supposed to be all about spice and savour doubles are basically pieces of fried dough filled with curried chickpeas and can be spicy or mild . you'd usually get them from a street vendor in trinidad . caribbean palace made me remember what it's like to stand outside in the heat of a sweltering day on a crowded street in penal and take my first bite of that doughy piece of heaven . the more of the food i ate i ordered a lot of it two chicken rotis , two doubles , one order of pholourie , one aloo pie the happier i became . my best friend , who agreed to make the trek with me , rhapsodized about it too . i'd recommend trying any of the food that we ordered . quick explanation of terms : roti is the indian version of middle eastern naan . we make ours thinner , much softer , and we stuff it with spices . we usually wrap this around chicken or goat meat and eat it with our hands be forewarned : we usually leave the bones in so ask for boneless if you prefer it . the portion sizes are really big , so bring a friend ! aloo pie is a pocket of fried dough stuffed with spicy potatoes . pholourie is like fried dumplings that come with a sweet and sour tamarind sauce . now that caribbean palace have proven themselves with the basics i trust that the rest of their menu is just as good as what we got be adventurous with your selections . if you don't know what something is , just ask . the girl who was working there when we went in at around 3:30pm on a friday was obviously raised here in the states no accent but she looked like a trini . i'm guessing her family runs the restaurant . she had an amazing memory i rattled off the list of what i wanted and she went right into the kitchen without hesitation . i was impressed . all of the food came out piping hot and smelling like home my mouth was watering as soon as she put the bag into my hands . about the area and the physical properties of the restaurant itself : takoma park may not be the nicest place in the world , but it's not that ghetto . for all of you who are familiar with manassas , virginia , it's that level of shady . bear in mind that this is coming from someone who's well versed in shadiness , but i wouldn't blink at going there by myself during the daylight hours . the parking lot was a little cramped and people were driving like people drive in maryland , but my car , my best friend , and myself made it back across the border unscathed . essential

. in those moments you could care less on how many calories you're consuming or how unhealthy the food you're eating actually is . well , if you find yourself in one of those moods , then you seriously need to check out fat sal's . the name alone should tell you what this place is all about ! fat sal's , which is located in westwood , is a small , take out only food stand . they do have a wood counter that you can choose to sit at , that wraps around the front of the restaurant . they also have a few hd tvs for you to enjoy while you get fatter . sal's menu consists of some of the most fattening sounding sandwiches , fries and wraps i have ever seen . they also offer some less fattening grub , like salads and veggie wraps , but who in their right mind would pay a visit to a place called fat sal's in search of healthy garbage . most of their sandwiches actually have the name fat included in them . some of these sandwiches are called the fat sal , the fat mona , the fat anthony and so on . after looking over their super fattening menu i decided to order their fat jerry . the cool thing about sal's is you can add anything on their menu to your fat sandwich for a small fee this is what came on my modified fat jerry garlic roll cheese steak chicken fingers mozzarella sticks crispy bacon fried eggs french fries hamburger patties i added this grilled onions i added this mayo ketchup hot damn , this sandwich was intense ! it was like there was a party in my mouth and every fat person on the block was invited . the cool thing was you could actually taste every element of this sandwich in every bite . this huge sandwich was also extremely messy . i had grease , ketchup , and mayo running down my arm and all over my face . it was freaking glorious . now , i'm not going to lie , some of the items they use are just store bought , pre packaged items chicken fingers , mozzarella sticks but that does not mean that this fat sandwich was not incredibly tasty , because it was . my friend and i also got an order of their bacon cheeseburger fries to share . these fries were served in a big , aluminum tin and topped with white and yellow cheeses , chopped up bacon and hamburger patties , lettuce , tomatoes , pickles and fat sauce thousand island these fries tasted just like a mcdonald's big mac with french fries mixed in it . they were really , really
